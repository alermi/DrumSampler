# DrumSampler

This is a VST plug-in project that plays pre-recorded drum samples from MIDI input. This was created using the JUCE framework and still being improved.
Only the source files are included in this GitHub repository. The project has only been tested for Windows 10.

The samples and the latest build files can be downloaded from:

## How to run:
1- Download the samples zip
2- Download the build file under x64 (.vst3 if you are going to run VST3 and .dll otherwise)
3- Unzip the samples and move the folder called DrumSamples in your Documents folder.
4- Move the build file to a directory recognized by your DAW as a plug-in path.
5- Have lots of fun

Note: Some of the samples are missing right now but will be added soon.
