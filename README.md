# DrumSampler

This is a VST plug-in project that plays pre-recorded drum samples from MIDI input. This was created using the JUCE framework and still being improved.  
Only the source files are included in this GitHub repository. The project has only been tested for Windows 10.  
  
The samples and the latest build files can be downloaded from:
